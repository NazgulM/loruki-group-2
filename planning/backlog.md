# Backlog

A collection of user stories for your project. Stories inside of each priority
level are not necessarily in order. You and your team will decide when to
develop each story by drawing out your [Story Sequencing](#story-sequencing).

## Must-Haves

are necessary for basic usability:

### Home page

- As a front-end developer I want to see the title of the website immediately so
  that I know that I'm on the right website

  - [ ] There is a prominent title of the website at the top

- As a photographer I want to know what this website is about so that i can
  decide if it's the right website for me

  - [ ] There is centered content that explains what Loruki can be used for

- As a front-end-developer I want to know how i can install Loruki to use it for
  my projects

  - [ ] There should be a terminal command on how to install Loruki

- As a front-end-developer i want to know what languages are supported by Loruki
  to determine if it can be used for my projects

  - [ ] Clearly shows all the supported languages on the home-page

- As a front-end developer i want to try out the demo before selecting Loruki as
  the suitable service provider for my company to ensure that it's a better
  deployment service than others
  - [ ] There should be a form that will take the information of a user and send
        her a demo version of Loruki

### Features

- As a photographer i want to know that the images on my website will retain
  it's quality so my work looks good
  - [ ] Have a features page that will explain the benefits of Loruki over other
        deployment service

### Docs

## Should-Haves

will complete the user experience, but are not necessary:

- As a front-end developer i want to be able to contact Loruki on social media
  and github to be able to ask questions and see any updates
  - [ ] Have a footer on all pages with contact infos for social medias and
        GitHub

## Could-Haves

would be really cool ... if there's time:

- As a photographer i want to know what i can click on

  - [ ] Have button and link animations that show that they can be clicked on

- As a front-end-developer i want to see the logos of the languages so it's
  faster and easier to recognize if a language that i use is supported

  - [ ] add logos to the languages and make them animated

- As a photographer i want to visit a website that is visually pleasing

  - [ ] Have a good background
  - [ ] Have pleasing color tones
  - [ ] when loading the website, there should be an animation giving a sense of
        interaction rather than static website

- As a front-end developer i want to know quick stats about Loruki to be able to
  present it to my company
  - [ ] Show how many deployments, projects and publications Loruki has
