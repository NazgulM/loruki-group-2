# Front End Developers

- **Bio**: Layla is a Front-end Developer at the start-up company. She likes to
  be creative and has quite some knowledge and experience about software as a
  service/platform as a service.

- **Needs/Goals**: She's looking for a developer-friendly cloud hosting platform
  that is language independent (supports all programming languages), quickly
  scaling, and continuously innovative which can support the development of the
  company in long run.

- **Frustrations**: The server often shutdowns when there is a massive spike in
  users, vendor Reliability, and pricing, as cloud service providers can be
  expensive for some startups using the technology.

- **Scenario 1**: Layla was asked by her manager to review all the advantages
  and disadvantages of the technology before moving to the cloud. When reviewing
  she needs to find other resources available to ensure that she selects a
  suitable service provider for the company's needs and budget.
