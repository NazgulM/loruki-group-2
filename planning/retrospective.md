# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- forgetting to link PR's to their respective issues

## Continue Doing

- Divide tasks into must-have should-have and could-have and focus on the
  must-have task in the development strategy first before trying to complete
  animations.
- Regular communication and briefing with team members

## Start Doing

- review PR's thoroughly and frequently before merging them to master

## Lessons Learned

- Good communication and collaboration with team members.
- how to resolve merge conflicts through the terminal and VS code locally as
  well as directly through Github.
- HTML and CSS concepts. We learned css grid, flex box and media queries.

## Strategy vs. Board

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Communication plan was done on the first day so we had regular video-calls to
  check in.
- User-personas were divided and thoroughly analyzed

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- All the backlog features of the home page are complete and we didn't add
  additional pages and features.
