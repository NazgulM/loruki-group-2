## A Photographer ðŸ“¸

- **Bio**: Iyob is an experienced photographer who is based in Heverlee,
  Belgium. He feels most at home in the mountains, forests, oceans etc. All of
  which are incorporated in his photography.
- **Needs/Goals**: Iyob captures moments of his travel experiences and he needs
  a high quality site to showcase his work and a place to store the rest of his
  collections.
- **Frustrations**: Iyob feels it is too difficult to organize his photos using
  current cloud storage services. He also has trouble when trying to upload
  multiple contents at the same time. He finds it frustrating to share several
  pictures at the same time.
- **Scenario 1**: There is an upcoming exihibition in August in Brussels where
  various photographers present their work. In order to participate in the
  exihibition, photographers have to submit their work in advance. Iyob wants to
  submit his work in an inclusive site.
