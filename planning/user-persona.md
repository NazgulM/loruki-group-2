## A Photographer ðŸ“¸

- **Bio**: Iyob is an experienced photographer who is based in Heverlee,
  Belgium. He feels most at home in the mountains, forests, oceans etc. All of
  which are incorporated in his photography.
- **Needs/Goals**: Iyob captures moments of his travel experiences and he needs
  a high quality site to showcase his work and a place to store the rest of his
  collections.
- **Frustrations**: Iyob feels it is too difficult to organize his photos using
  current cloud storage services. He also has trouble when trying to upload
  multiple contents at the same time. He finds it frustrating to share several
  pictures at the same time. He also wants to deploy his website so it loads
  quickly while also maintaining the high quality resolution of his pictures
- **Scenario 1**: There is an upcoming exhibition in August in Brussels where
  various photographers present their work. In order to participate in the
  exhibition, photographers have to submit their work in advance. Iyob wants to
  submit his work in an inclusive site.

## Front End Developers

- **Bio**: Layla is a Front-end Developer at the start-up company. She likes to
  be creative and has quite some knowledge and experience about software as a
  service/platform as a service.

- **Needs/Goals**: She's looking for a developer-friendly cloud hosting platform
  that is language independent (supports all programming languages), quickly
  scaling, and continuously innovative which can support the development of the
  company in long run.

- **Frustrations**: The server often shutdowns when there is a massive spike in
  users, vendor Reliability, and pricing, as cloud service providers can be
  expensive for some startups using the technology.

- **Scenario 1**: Layla was asked by her manager to review all the advantages
  and disadvantages of the technology before moving to the cloud. When reviewing
  she needs to find other resources available to ensure that she selects a
  suitable service provider for the company's needs and budget.
